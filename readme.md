This is an experiment.

the kit has two editors. one for stacks. one for containers.

You can add container modules to your kit.
a module has:
- containers with output in html/css (part of your skin)
- containers with editing interface (standardised or custom)
- container settings
- container storage, if needed

You can "pull" container modules, similar to a plugin architecture.
